# DeepSeek-V3 Weight Conversion

Important: Before weight conversion, first confirm the parameter configuration used during training. Configure `ckpt_convert_xxx.sh` based on the parameters in the training script `pretrain_xxx.sh` or `tune_xxx.sh`.

## 1. HF2MG/MG2HF Weight Conversion

### 1.1 Conversion Script Configuration and Execution

(1) Hugging Face to Megatron

- The script converts [Hugging Face weights](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/tree/main) to distributed Megatron MCore weights for tasks such as fine-tuning, inference, and evaluation. The original weights must be dequantized to obtain data in the BF16 format. For the dequantization method, see the [code](https://modelers.cn/models/MindIE/deepseekv3/blob/main/NPU_inference/fp8_cast_bf16.py) officially provided by MindIE.

- Configure the <a href="../../mcore/deepseek3/ckpt_convert_deepseek3_hf2mcore.sh">ckpt_convert_deepseek3_hf2mcore.sh</a> script in the DeepSeek-V3 model directory with the same configuration as the training script, and then run the conversion:

```shell
bash examples/mcore/deepseek3/ckpt_convert_deepseek3_hf2mcore.sh
```

(2) Megatron to Hugging Face

- The script converts trained distributed Megatron MCore weights back to the Hugging Face format.

- Configure the <a href="../../mcore/deepseek3/ckpt_convert_deepseek3_mcore2hf.sh">ckpt_convert_deepseek3_mcore2hf.sh</a> script in the DeepSeek-V3 model directory with the same configuration as the training script, and then run the conversion:

```shell
bash examples/mcore/deepseek3/ckpt_convert_deepseek3_mcore2hf.sh
```

(3) LoRA/QLoRA to Hugging Face

- The script converts trained LoRA/QLoRA weights to the Hugging Face format.

- Configure the <a href="../../mcore/deepseek3/ckpt_convert_deepseek3_merge_lora2hf.sh">ckpt_convert_deepseek3_merge_lora2hf.sh</a> script in the DeepSeek-V3 model directory with the same configuration as the training script, and then run the conversion:

```shell
bash examples/mcore/deepseek3/ckpt_convert_deepseek3_merge_lora2hf.sh
```

## 2. LoRA Weight Conversion

### 2.1 LoRA Weights with Base Weights

If LoRA weights contain base weights and they must be merged before conversion to the Hugging Face format:

Example

```bash
python examples/mcore/deepseek3/convert_ckpt_deepseek3_mcore2hf.py \
    --source-tensor-parallel-size 1 \
    --source-pipeline-parallel-size 4 \
    --source-expert-parallel-size 8 \
    --load-dir ./model_weights/deepseek3-lora \
    --save-dir ./model_from_hf/deepseek3-hf \
    --num-layers 61 \
    --first-k-dense-replace 3 \
    --num-layer-list 16,15,15,15 \
    --lora-r 8 \
    --lora-alpha 16
```

`--load-dir`: Specifies the LoRA weight path. The weights include base weights and LoRA weights.

`--lora-r`: Rank of the LoRA matrix. This value must match the configuration used during LoRA fine-tuning.

`--lora-alpha`: Scaling factor. It scales the contribution of the low-rank matrix and must match the configuration used during LoRA fine-tuning.

[Applicable scenario] During LoRA fine-tuning, if the `--lora-ckpt-filter` parameter is not added, the saved weights include base weights and LoRA weights.

### 2.2 Loading LoRA Weights and Base Weights Separately

If base weights and separate LoRA weights must be merged and converted to the Hugging Face format, specify two paths separately for loading:

Example

```bash
python examples/mcore/deepseek3/convert_ckpt_deepseek3_mcore2hf.py \
    --source-tensor-parallel-size 1 \
    --source-pipeline-parallel-size 4 \
    --source-expert-parallel-size 8 \
    --load-dir ./model_weights/deepseek3-mcore \
    --lora-load ./ckpt/filter_lora \
    --save-dir ./model_from_hf/deepseek3-hf \
    --num-layers 61 \
    --first-k-dense-replace 3 \
    --num-layer-list 16,15,15,15 \
    --lora-r 8 \
    --lora-alpha 16
    # Configure parameters such as --num-layer-list, --noop-layers, and --num-layers-per-virtual-pipeline-stage based on task requirements.
```

`--load-dir`: Specifies the base weight path.

`--lora-load`: Specifies the LoRA weight path. Note that these weights contain only LoRA weights. During LoRA fine-tuning, add `--lora-ckpt-filter` to save only LoRA weights.

`--lora-r` and `--lora-alpha`: These values must match the configuration used during LoRA fine-tuning.

[Applicable scenario] During LoRA fine-tuning, if the `--lora-ckpt-filter` parameter is added, the saved weights contain only LoRA weights, and you must merge LoRA and Hugging Face weights.

### 2.3 Converting Only LoRA Weights to the Hugging Face Format

If separate LoRA weights must be converted to the Hugging Face format:

```bash
python examples/mcore/deepseek3/convert_ckpt_deepseek3_mcore2hf.py \
    --source-tensor-parallel-size 1 \
    --source-pipeline-parallel-size 4 \
    --source-expert-parallel-size 4 \
    --load-dir ./ckpt/lora_v3_filter \
    --save-dir ./model_from_hf/deepseek3-hf \
    --num-layers 61 \
    --first-k-dense-replace 3 \
    --num-layer-list 16,15,15,15 \
    --save-lora-to-hf \
    --lora-r 8 \
    --lora-alpha 16 \
    --lora-target-modules linear_qkv linear_proj linear_fc1 linear_fc2
```

`--load-dir`: Specifies the LoRA weight path. Note that these weights contain only LoRA weights. During LoRA fine-tuning, add `--lora-ckpt-filter` to save only LoRA weights.

`--lora-target-modules`: Defines the LoRA target modules as a string list separated by spaces. This parameter has no default value. Each string is the name of a layer that requires LoRA fine-tuning.

`--save-lora-to-hf`: Specifies conversion of only LoRA weights to the Hugging Face format. Note that these weights contain only LoRA weights. During LoRA fine-tuning, add `--lora-ckpt-filter` to save only LoRA weights.

[Applicable scenario] During LoRA fine-tuning, if the `--lora-ckpt-filter` parameter is added, the saved weights contain only LoRA weights and only LoRA weights are converted to the Hugging Face format.

## 3. QLoRA Weight Conversion

### 3.1 QLoRA Weights with Base Weights

If QLoRA weights contain base weights and they must be merged before conversion to the Hugging Face format:

Add `--qlora-save-dequantize` to the fine-tuning script to dequantize the weights during saving.

[Applicable scenario] During QLoRA fine-tuning, if the `--lora-ckpt-filter` parameter is not added, the saved weights include base weights and QLoRA weights.

Use the same merge script as `2.1 LoRA Weights with Base Weights`.

### 3.2 Loading QLoRA Weights and Base Weights Separately

If base weights and separate QLoRA weights must be merged and converted to the Hugging Face format, specify two paths separately for loading:

Example

```bash
python examples/mcore/deepseek3/convert_ckpt_deepseek3_mcore2hf.py \
    --source-tensor-parallel-size 1 \
    --source-pipeline-parallel-size 4 \
    --source-expert-parallel-size 8 \
    --load-dir ./model_weights/deepseek3-mcore \
    --lora-load ./ckpt/filter_lora \
    --save-dir ./model_from_hf/deepseek3-hf \
    --num-layers 61 \
    --first-k-dense-replace 3 \
    --num-layer-list 16,15,15,15 \
    --lora-r 8 \
    --lora-alpha 16
    # Configure parameters such as --num-layer-list, --noop-layers, and --num-layers-per-virtual-pipeline-stage based on task requirements.
```

`--load-dir`: Specifies the base weight path. Because QLoRA fine-tuning loads quantized weights, you cannot directly use them as base weights. Export another copy of MCore weights without the `--qlora-nf4` parameter as the base weights for merging.

`--lora-load`: Specifies the QLoRA weight path. Note that these weights contain only QLoRA weights. In the fine-tuning script, add `--qlora-save-dequantize` to dequantize the weights during saving, and add `--lora-ckpt-filter` to save only QLoRA weights.

`--lora-r` and `--lora-alpha`: These values must match the configuration used during LoRA fine-tuning.

[Applicable scenario] During QLoRA fine-tuning, if the `--lora-ckpt-filter` parameter is added, the saved weights contain only QLoRA weights and you must merge QLoRA weights and Hugging Face weights.

### 3.3 Converting Only QLoRA Weights to the Hugging Face Format

If separate QLoRA weights must be converted to the Hugging Face format, add `--qlora-save-dequantize` to the fine-tuning script to dequantize the weights during saving, and add `--lora-ckpt-filter` to save only QLoRA weights.

Use the same conversion script as `2.3 Converting Only LoRA Weights to the Hugging Face Format`.

[Applicable scenario] During QLoRA fine-tuning, if the `--lora-ckpt-filter` parameter is added, the saved weights contain only LoRA weights and only LoRA weights are converted to the Hugging Face format.
